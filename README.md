# Transition-metal-oxide-perovskites_electrocatalysis
Contains all data (computational and experimental) done for TMO perovskites (except cluster-expansion)
This file contains description of the work we are doing.
The main aim of this project is to explore LaMnO3 and LaNiO3 perovskite oxides for electrocatalytic activity such as Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) and Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR). 
At the initial stage pure compounds are studied and then strategic amounts of dopings are done on diffrent sites in order to find the optimal activity of these perovskite materials.
